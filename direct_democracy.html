    <h1>Web3 as the Foundation for Direct Democracy</h1>
    <p>
      Traditional representative democracy relied on intermediaries and slow processes. Delegating authority to a few politicians was necessary in the past due to logistical limitations. Today, digital tools make direct citizen participation possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Traditional Democracy Is Becoming Outdated</h2>
    <p>
      Political elites are not inherently better informed than the public. Collective intelligence often outperforms small closed groups, especially when participation is frictionless and information is open.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Web3, citizens can directly vote on laws, monitor officials, and take action without relying on intermediaries.
    </p>

    <h2>Direct Voting via Blockchain</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Vote on policies and laws directly.</li>
      <li>Revise decisions and vote again if needed.</li>
      <li>Enable a self-correcting governance system rather than being locked into long election cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Radical Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain-based governance allows public officials’ actions to be visible in real time. Every transaction, decision, and communication is logged and auditable, eliminating closed-door governance.
    </p>

    <h2>Accountability Through Collective Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      Public profiles and feedback systems allow citizens to monitor officials. If negative feedback exceeds a threshold, automatic consequences can be applied, such as removal from office or investigation.
    </p>

    <h2>Web3 Tools Are Ready Today</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Smartphones and internet access are widespread.</li>
      <li>Open-source blockchain networks support secure, censorship-resistant systems.</li>
      <li>Smart contracts can automate voting and governance.</li>
      <li>Web3 engineers can implement these systems now.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cyberalism: The Next Era</h2>
    <p>
      Moving beyond centralized political and corporate power, cyberalism emphasizes decentralized authority, continuous participation, and transparency. Web3 is already enabling this transformation.
